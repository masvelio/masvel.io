This is a repository for my personal blog. The idea behind the blog was to share the process of creating the product, starting from the idea, through the conceprual work, development, untill the release of the product.

As a huge fan of [Notion](https://notion.so) I was wondering if is it possible to use that tool as a CMS for my blog. The bad thing is that Notion does not provide API (they are working on it, though). However, there are open source projects that tries to reverse engineer the API, so I decided to give it a try.
